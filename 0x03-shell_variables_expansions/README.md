[Go to Task 7 - 7-create_global_variable](./7-create_global_variable)

## Task 8: Every Addition to True Knowledge is an Addition to Human Power
**Description:** This script prints the result of adding 128 to the value stored in the `TRUEKNOWLEDGE` environment variable.

[Go to Task 8 - 8-true_knowledge](./8-true_knowledge)

## Task 9: Divide and Rule
**Description:** This script prints the result of dividing the value stored in the `POWER` environment variable by the value stored in the `DIVIDE` environment variable.

[Go to Task 9 - 9-divide_and_rule](./9-divide_and_rule)

## Task 10: Love is Anterior to Life, Posterior to Death, Initial of Creation, and the Exponent of Breath
**Description:** This script displays the result of raising the value stored in the `BREATH` environment variable to the power of the value stored in the `LOVE` environment variable.

The number will be stored in the environment variable `NUM`.

- [Go to Task 13 - 13-print_float](./13-print_float)

## Task 100: Decimal to Hexadecimal Conversion

**Description:** This script converts a number from base 10 to base 16. The number in base 10 is stored in the environment variable `DECIMAL`. The script displays the number in base 16.

- [Go to Task 100 - 100-decimal_to_hexadecimal](./100-decimal_to_hexadecimal)

## Task 101: ROT13 Encryption
